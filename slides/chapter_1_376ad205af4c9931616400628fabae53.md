## What Is SQL View?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 94525b0598
```

`@part1`
- A view is the result of a stored query in database.{{1}}
- It has rows and columns like a table.{{2}}
- However, unlike a table, a view does not store any data.{{3}}
- Restricts user access to specific fields in a table.{{4}}

`@script`
Okay, so what is SQL view? SQL view is the result of a stored query in database. You can think of it as a virtual table defined based on a specific query that you can access all the time in database.

A view has rows and columns like a table. Since it is the result of a query, its output includes both rows and columns like when you query a table.

However, unlike a table, a view does not store any data.
